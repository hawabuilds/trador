 * The one market-cap calculation in this app.

 * — the feed row, the chart header, the info panel — goes through here, against
 * the same supply and the same price, so they cannot disagree.
 *
 * They used to. The feed printed the server's snapshot, the chart header
 * recomputed its own figure from the live tape, and the info panel below that
 * header printed the server's snapshot again — three renderings of one number,
 * two of them on the same screen. Measured against production, every token
 * sampled disagreed between the feed and its own page, by up to twelve percent,
 * and the gap was entirely price: the two surfaces were reading the same pool
 * through separately timed caches.
